## Introduction

The purpose of PandaScripts is to streamline the data processing workflow involved in experimental and modeling tasks. It aims to provide a collection of scripts and tools that facilitate various stages of data processing, including preprocessing, post-processing, and analysis.

## Features

- **EBSD Data Post-processing**: Scripts for post-processing EBSD (Electron Backscatter Diffraction) data using MTEX software, allowing for efficient analysis and visualization of crystallographic information.
- **Phase Field Simulation Preprocessing**: Tools and scripts for preprocessing data required for phase field simulations, including setting up initial conditions, defining material parameters, and generating input files.
- **Simulation Results Post-processing**: Scripts for analyzing and visualizing simulation results obtained from phase field simulations, enabling the extraction of relevant information and insights.

## Directory Structure

- **DataPreprocessing**: Contains scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, augmentation, and preparation.
- **PostProcessing**: Contains scripts and notebooks for results analysis, visualization, and interpretation.
- **Notes**: Contains project notes, documentation, and memos for reference.
