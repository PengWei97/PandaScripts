1. “The Σ3 coherent twin is of exceptionally low mobility, both experimentally and in this study. It is reasonable to hypothesize that boundaries that are crystallographically close to the coherent twin (perhaps sharing structural elements with it) would be slow as well.”

3. The formation of twins decreases total interfacial energy. Twins prefer to nucleate at GBs or triple junctions to reduce GB energies through orientation changes, and high twin density leads to lower average GB excess energy. 
   1. Owing to the low energy state of TBs, the nanotwinned structures exhibit very high thermal stability and much better retention of strength upon annealing, as compared with nanocrystalline and ultrafine-grained metals (34).

5.  It has been proposed that in these samples coherent twin boundaries (CTBs) provide critical energy barriers, preventing slip transits from one twin to another, therefore leading to high yield stress.

1. Twin structures obtained during deformation have an impact on the process of recrystallisation, mainly on recrystallisation kinetics.
   1. In the RD sample, in which twin structures were not observed, recrystallisation occurred rapidly. After 1 h, approximately 75% of grains were recrystallised. In the TD sample (with a high fraction of twins), the same degree of recrystallisation was reached after 2.5 h. 
   2.  twinning dislocations cannot penetrate the twin boundaries
   3. The significant impact of twin structures on recrystallization is further indicated. A detailed comparison of properties between materials with twins and those without, as presented in our studies, leads to the conclusion that twins play a crucial role in the kinetics of the recrystallization process. Our observations align with conclusions presented in references [34–36], supporting the hypothesis that dislocations cannot penetrate twin boundaries. This effect facilitates subsequent recrystallization and growth. Furthermore, Griffiths et al. [37] and Zeng et al. [38] hypothesized that recrystallized grains within twins generally cannot grow beyond twin boundaries, limiting their contribution to the final texture. Similar observations were made by Guan et al. [39], who noted that twins did not recrystallize during the entire annealing process and were consumed by adjacent recrystallized grains during grain growth. These effects arise from the minimal accumulation of dislocations and consequent low elastic strain energy along twin boundaries. Considering the results presented in this paper and other studies, we assume that twins significantly slow down the recrystallization process.

2. Although recrystallization nucleated preferentially inside the contraction twins, producing a distribution of new orientations (far from the unde sirable starting c-axis fiber texture), these new grains did not significantly influence the final texture.

   2. Recrystallization could not be completed in the cast sample deformed by 5%, indicating that the strain applied was insufficient to uniformly initiate recrystallization across the sample. As extension twinning occurred extensively at low strains, the material may not have accumulated the critical levels of stored energy necessary to drive recrystallization to completion.

Fig. 11(b) reveals that a pre-existing twin boundary (red color boundary) in the parent grain has started losing its coherency as the misorientation deviates from the original Σ3 misorientation of 60° with an allowed deviation up to 8.7° as per Brandon's criterion.
